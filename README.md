Notes:

Fixed the Close button error that Eva pointed out

Added Action->Undo Manual Detect in Menu Bar

Added -> shortcut to unselect tip(ctrl Z), delete tip on the fly
         draw reference point on the fly
         change draw_tip color and size

Changed -> display mode check box -> only affect the output of "Display Tips" button
           length and angle will always show on textEdit and export to csv file

P.S When you change reference point after manually selected tips,the result of "export manual data" is corrent, but now the program would not update the (x,y,length,angle) textEdit on the fly.
Should we bother changing it?
